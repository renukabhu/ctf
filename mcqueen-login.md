# Mcqueen Login

McQueen Login is a challenge where a JWT needs to be changed to get the flag. The first thing I did when looking at the challenge was inspect element to get the original JWT:

Once I got the token, I put it into jwt.io to see the following:

From this information, I knew that I needed to change admin to true, but was not sure what else to do since inputting the token with just false changed to true did not do anything This is when I did some research and realized that one can set the algorithm to none which I learned from the hack tricks website. However, when I tried to change my values on the jwt.io website, I received no output. 

After some time, I learned that JWTs are actually encoded in base 64, so I could encode and decode tokens using a base 64 encoder/decoder. Using a base 64 encoder and decoder, I changed the algorithm to none and set admin to true which gave me the following payload: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJhZG1pbiI6ICJ0cnVlIn0.

Others that I saw attempt this challenge also struggled with forgetting to keep the dot at the end, however the dot is necessary to get the flag. After changing the JWT field to my new token using inspect element, I got the flag:
